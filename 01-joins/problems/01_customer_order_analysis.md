# Problem 1: Customer Order Analysis

## Business Scenario

Your e-commerce manager needs a comprehensive report showing customer 
purchasing behavior. They want to understand which customers are actively 
buying, how much they're spending, and when they last made a purchase.

## Requirements

Create a query that shows:

1. **Customer Information**: Full name and email
2. **Order Summary**: 
   - Total number of orders per customer
   - Total amount spent across all orders
   - Average order value
   - Date of their most recent order
3. **Filtering**: Only include customers who have actually placed orders
4. **Sorting**: Order by total amount spent (highest first)
